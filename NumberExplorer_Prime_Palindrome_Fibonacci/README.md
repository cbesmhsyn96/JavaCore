# Number Explorer: Prime, Palindrome, and Fibonacci Checker

A modular Java project to explore number-based algorithms such as prime number detection, palindrome checking, and Fibonacci sequence generation. Each feature is implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches, making it ideal for educational purposes.

## Features

### Prime Number Detection

- Lists all prime numbers up to a user-defined limit.
- Includes both recursive and iterative implementations.

### Palindrome Checker

- Checks if a given string or number is a palindrome.
- Implemented with both recursion and loop-based approaches.

### Fibonacci Operations

- Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.
- Verifies whether a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.

## 📌 Notes

- Modular design with clear separation of concerns via packages.
- Educational comparison between recursive and non-recursive algorithms.
- Shared utilities (scanner, regex patterns, constants) are centralized.
- Easy to extend with additional number theory features (e.g., perfect numbers).
